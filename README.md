Genalog is an open source, cross-platform python package for **gen**erating document images with synthetic noise that mimics scanned an**alog** documents (thus the name `genalog`). You can also add various text degradations to these images. The purpose of this tool is to provide a fast and efficient way to generate synthetic documents from text data by leveraging layout from templates that you create in simple HTML format.

This repo is now in maintenance mode with **limited support**.

Overview
-------------------------------------
Genalog has various capabilities: 

1. Flexible format Image Generation
1. Custom image degradation
1. Extract Text from Images using Cognitive Search Pipeline
1. Get OCR Performance Metrics 

The aim of this project is to provide a complete solution for generating synthetic images from any text data rich in natural language and to imitate most of OCR noises founded in scanned text documents. 

Please refer to our [Genalog documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/genalog) for more tutorials.

## Installation
See the [Genalog install guide](https://microsoft.github.io/genalog/installation.html) for more details.

To install the latest release:

`pip install genalog`

### Extra Installation Steps in MacOs and Windows
We have a dependency on [`Weasyprint`](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), which in turn has non-python dependencies including `Pango`, `cairo` and `GDK-PixBuf` that need to be installed separately.

So far, `Pango`, `cairo` and `GDK-PixBuf` libraries are available in `Ubuntu-18.04` and later by default.

If you are running on Windows, MacOS, or other Linux distributions, please see [installation instructions from WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

**NOTE**: If you encounter the errors like `no library called "libcairo-2" was found`, this is probably due to the three extra dependencies missing.

## Getting Started

The following is a summary of the common applications scenarios of Genalog. Please refer the [Jupyter notebook examples](https://github.com/microsoft/genalog/blob/master/example) that make use of the core code base of Genalog and repository utilities.

### Other Requirements:

1. If you want to use the OCR Capabilities of Azure to Extract Text from the Images You'll require the following resources: 
    1. Azure Cognitive Search Service [Quickstart Guide Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
    1. Azure Blob Storage [Quickstart Guide Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-create-account-block-blob?tabs=azure-portal)
    
    See [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) for more information on Azure Cognitive Search.


Package Release
-------------------
Please see [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/microsoft/genalog/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for more details on the release process.

Development with the Repo
--------------------------
We use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to orchestrate most of the CI procedure. This will ensure the maximum environment parity between local dev boxes and remote CI pipelines.

1. `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/genalog.git`
2. `pip install tox`
3. To run static analysis: `tox -e flake8`
4. To run the test suites: `tox -e -- -m "not azure"`
