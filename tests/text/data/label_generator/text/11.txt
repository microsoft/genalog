And you, Yang Yang? A friend happened to call me. You were not at work that day? No. The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program. Uh-huh, that means, er, you found out the accident through an information source at the station. Right, right, right. Uh-huh. Well, like Professor Zhou, I also received this news, ha, through a mobile phone SMS. At that time,, it can be said that this SMS was among the many, ha, SMS containing New Year wishes, like Happy New Year, received after the start of the New Year. Uh-huh. Ah, actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS. Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much, I think it is very useful, ah, to inform people of this kind of news. Yes, exceptionally. Yes, exceptionally. Well, what in fact was the content of that SMS? Let's take a look via this footage, ha. I remember the SMS was written like this at that time, saying that, ah, there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road, and, well, traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road, Jingguang Bridge, and East Third Ring Road,  and requesting cars to make a detour. Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent. Furthermore, there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support. Ah, after the SMS was sent ,, I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality, ah, used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency. I don't know, all of us are living in Beijing, is this the first time, Professor Zhou? Yes, in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860. Uh-huh.
