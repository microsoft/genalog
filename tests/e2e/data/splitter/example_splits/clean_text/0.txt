What kind of memory ? 
We respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of Across China ! ! ! 
WW II Landmarks on the Great Earth of China : Eternal Memories of Taihang Mountain Standing tall on Taihang Mountain is the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive . 
It is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the Great Wall , among other things . 
A primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles . 
The Hundred Regiments Offensive was the campaign of the largest scale launched by the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance against Japan . 
This campaign broke through the Japanese army 's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines , stirring up anti-Japanese spirit throughout the nation and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide . 
This is Zhuanbi Village , Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province , where the Eighth Route Army was headquartered back then . 
On a wall outside the headquarters we found a map . 
This map was the Eighth Route Army 's depiction of the Mediterranean Sea situation at that time . 
This map reflected the European battlefield situation . 
In 1940 , the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Netherlands , Belgium , and France . 
It was during this year that the Japanese army developed a strategy to rapidly force the Chinese people into submission by the end of 1940 . 
In May , the Japanese army launched -- From one side , it seized an important city in China called Yichang . 
Um , , uh , through Yichang , it could directly reach Chongqing . 
Ah , that threatened Chongqing . 
Then they would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as Chongqing . 
So , along with the coordinated , er , economic blockade , military offensives , and strategic bombings , er , a simultaneous attack was launched in Hong Kong to lure the KMT government into surrender . 
The progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then . 
By 1940 , China 's War of Resistance against Japan had entered a stalemate . 
The situation on our side and the enemy 's side was intertwined . 
The Eighth Route Army guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in North China . 
Hayao Tada , commander of the Japanese North China Area Army , adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with the Eighth Route Army . 
The specific method was building a closely connected transport network , with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road . 
Roads and railways were used as links to connect all of North China into a solid , widespread siege , in order to strangle the Eighth Route Army and its base areas in this net . 
As part of the Japanese army 's strategy of siege warfare , railways and roads had actually become the Japanese army 's weapons of war , becoming a great threat to the base areas . 
In December 1939 , Commander - in - chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the Eighth Route Army received a top - secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District , among other people . 
The telegram said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability . 
Before the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in China . 
Well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate the area under its occupation , Japan began a new strategy . 
That was to use railways as a pillar , roads as a chain , and strongholds as a lock , to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines , ah , so as , er , to cut off their communication with one another . 
In addition , it relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas . 
Er . 
So , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the Eighth Route Army led by the Chinese Communist Party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called the Hundred Regiments Offensive . 
This plot of the Japanese army drew great attention from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai of Eighth Route Army headquarters . 
After meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated .
