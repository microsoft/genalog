So , al - jazeera TV station seized this opportunity to get hold of , this encies group of people by faring them , or , at their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries , Uhuh . So, they had a relatively good team of reporters . Un fun . Well , this way , later it followed that , or ! or. . , er , six - Chanese character prix loss of news reporting cased , er , independence , neutraity , an , neveraity , basece and freedom Un fun . Uh-huh. So , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other Arab TV stations. Right . in thas respect , that is , bet me add one powx , that is , this al- Jazeera TV station, ah , it's style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the west , for in stance , the two mainstream media outlets un-ten . Unsoon. Right . Un toh One is CAN, and the other is BSC . Yeah , Well , I think that BBC , in particular . hes grate s bag influence on it . Just now that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the societe fast charmed of that time . Un fam . That was jointty pin by Bec and Saudi Arsexia ! So I had s very good foundation! in adition , that is . actually . this aljazeera TV station has a quite unique structure. That's because the one of this country is caked Hamad : He studied in Britain and therefore had quite a good knowsedge of Bream's BBC TV station , He also ques adriwed . .So, in this way, it has borrowed some of the BBC style . For instance, Britain's BNC is a very old TV group established in 1927 . Un hon: Though it is funded by the government with many of is properties owned by the government , at the fodoes the guideline of ta ter's independence . Un-hun For iatance, the top deckion . making body of BBC is called the board of director which are composed of twelve members sweetly appointed by the Queen . Unnun, So at Jazeera TV station has onto adopted that structure . It has a top seven . member board of directors . Un huh . Un tech . However , even! it's property, an , and funds can come from the government . R gis relatively has its . Mortal independence. En, but in essence, be Wy, is it ready a private TV station or government . nun TV station ? Er , they themselves claim that & is a private TV station , but in revery I could not have been established weneed a large amount of financial support given by the govern mart. That's because it, eh, has an extremely small number of ads during as around the clock, an. TVbroadcast Un hun Un hun ! well, in audition , at has such a large team , especially with high , high er, wages , and reporters based abroad, so many reporters abroad. If the government had not sug ported wich exper Stures , on, It would be impossible for a private TV station to survive , According to your knowledge , how much is its yearty expenditure ? it was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 bastion US dollars. About 7 bibion US dollars, that is equivalent to more than 50 bastion Road We showed say this is a very huge financial expenditure, Un fun. Extremely large. wan. Therefore, some people call it gaining woke but kising money because it has relatively imas revenues due to few ads Ut hun Unfun Union , Un tan. But it has a tremendous influence. Right. So. It appears that * is sod not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect, wan. He was, speaking of its andtu ence , we have ano nocked that or, during the Alphon was, er, because it has the exclusive interview right to enter Mohantion to conduct independent and cocksive interviews, we could say this is one of is advantages, Uhiuhi, & ano presented an opportunity for as sex. wet, to the development of a TV station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important ) well , as al Jazeera TV sta tion has been was to develop see as current status. what do you think has & robed upon so that its competitiveness and invential power , even surpassed CAN and BAC during the iraq war ? The great west feature of al jazeera TV station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become wed . known through wars . That is, the reason why it can establish itself is that it first resed on the Action war, and then the way war after the 9/ 11, Unfun Chifue So, It made fod use of these two opportunities . in addition, as the iraq war occurred right in an Arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war . So , thus provides it with a large viewership. making it instantly famous . Un hurt , Un fish . Besides , i has a lot of resources , including it's exckative coverage right in Afghanistan as you mentioned wist now . Un ton , un tan . in addition , al Jazeera TV station is actualy quite ious in the Arab rection, For instance , a very tough commut ie this region is the conflict between Palestine and barzel unfun Utton. Well, in gerard, Arabs wie nick wake the trash leader in make a speech on their TV. However, for al jazeera TV station , It could inyee Barak the israel prime minister at that time , to debver a speech at al Jazeera TV station , This was un precedented in the Arab world . Right . Un huh . Well , this also gave it a very unique perspective . Un
