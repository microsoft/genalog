I think, actually, as for as japan aself is concerned, If we made some mes takes by Rest For instance , actualty Forrud won an overwhelming victory in the general election aid on September 11 this your. At the same time tus power to form the cabinet was father strength ened . Untun. wantun Uniton. It , he memos thought, or, that he was probably !, or, 200 % cox rect in what he has been doing . Uthan. However, in his diplomack efforts, in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well . . we can say that he iidend failed miserably . Under. Wes, this kself also failed to meet japan's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries , in particular . the eastern Asian region , well . to is to bring about economic cooperation in this region . un feel . Un- tion . well , looking at Japan 's economy . we showed say & is currently recovering is growth. well, externady, I mainly relies on the US and Chinese markets . Un huh, However , If the Chinese market suffers from economic cool down as political coldness takes heat off economic development , I should produce a very negative effect on Japan 's economy . Un huff . This effect may not show unell probably next year , Un fun. wes , just now that is to say . It was the poutical coldness that tocaty damaged it's relations with neighboring coun tries , Un-tun . Then , in terms of economny, he has also been unable to keep the economic heat on unitin well, we know, what of of is should be more concerned is tos foure in reemational off me's That is . this year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations . un noun , Japan placed it hope of becoming a permanent member of the Securty Counce this your, Un hun . wet ! generally speaking . If a could n't get accepted this year, was , the chances in ture are extremely shim . Unhun . well, among many reasons that blocked Japan from getting accepted this year , the most important one was that is neighboring countries did not cast favorsout votes, That is, It and not " It faced to gain the support of countries in it's own ragan, Right, to become a permanent member of the Securty Council, the most important thing is to must win the support of your own region . Right . well, right now & is is neighboring countries the and not support . Un tion.
