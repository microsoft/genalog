these	O

However	O

it	O

It	O

On	O
April	B-DATE

when	O

was	O

they	O

some	O

That	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
five	B-CARDINAL

Right	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
memo	O
,	O
Bush	B-PERSONNAME
seemed	O
to	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

At	O
that	O

Blair	B-PERSONNAME
tried	O
his	O

it	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
very	O
authenticity	O
of	O
the	O
incident	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
still	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
British	B-NORP

or	O
US	B-GPE

They	O
need	O
to	O
come	O

Yeah	O

Well	O
,	O
Mr.	O

we	O

ah	O
,	O
you	O

with	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION

So	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
this	O

?	O

Do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
real	O
or	O
not	O
?	O

Um	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
wanted	O
to	O
bomb	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION

Uh-huh	O

That	O
's	O
because	O

since	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

What	O
they	O
reported	O
was	O
entirely	O
incompatible	O
with	O

so	O
-	O
called	O
freedom	O
of	O

advocated	O
by	O

Uh-huh	O

attacked	O

several	O

It	O

that	O
when	O

,	O
er	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
that	O
Defense	O
Secretary	O
Rumsfeld	B-PERSONNAME
visited	O
Qatar	B-GPE
,	O
they	O
,	O
put	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
Qatari	B-NORP
government	O
,	O
saying	O
you	O
should	O
not	O

these	O

that	O
were	O
harmful	O
to	O
the	O
US	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
later	O

under	O

eh	O
,	O
the	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

,	O

,	O
ah	O
,	O
Qatar	B-GPE
replied	O
that	O
we	O
advocate	O
the	O
same	O
freedom	O
of	O
the	O
press	O
as	O
the	O
freedom	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
your	O

and	O
that	O
our	O

has	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
interfere	O
with	O
what	O
is	O
being	O
reported	O
by	O
a	O
private	O
TV	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
your	O
judgment	O
,	O
this	O
incident	O
was	O
possible	O
because	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
has	O
long	O
considered	O
it	O
a	O
thorn	O
in	O
its	O
flesh	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
government	O
or	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
president	O
had	O
such	O
an	O
idea	O
,	O
you	O
think	O
many	O
people	O
may	O
easily	O
believe	O
it	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
such	O
possibility	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
yes	O
.	O

All	O
right	O
,	O
regarding	O
whether	O
this	O
incident	O
was	O
real	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
you	O
two	B-CARDINAL
,	O
eh	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
indeed	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

There	O
are	O
no	O

Right	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
