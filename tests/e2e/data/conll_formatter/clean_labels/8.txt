we	O
should	O
watch	O
for	O
regarding	O
which	O
road	O
exactly	O
Japan	B-GPE
will	O
take	O
.	O
However	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
selection	O
and	O
formation	O
of	O
his	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
cabinet	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME

That	O
is	O
,	O
in	O

I	O
now	O
feel	O
that	O
he	O

somewhat	O
adopting	O
a	O
China	B-GPE
policy	O
that	O

believe	O
completely	O
100	B-PERCENT

of	O
what	O
he	O

they	O
will	O
make	O
accommodations	O
to	O
let	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME

We	O

such	O
as	O
Sadakazu	B-PERSONNAME

not	O
to	O
continue	O

for	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
will	O
continue	O

monitor	O
Japan	B-GPE

For	O
our	O

Uh-huh	O

,	O
as	O
we	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
purpose	O
for	O

to	O
go	O

I	O
think	O
that	O

the	O

achievement	O
for	O
him	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
facts	O

Japan	B-GPE
is	O
