the	O

that	O
it	O

,	O
why	O
?	O
Uh-huh	O

That	O
is	O

So	O
it	O
may	O
be	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
,	O
now	O
the	O
JDA	B-ORGANIZATION
head	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
the	O

actually	O
the	O

again	O
partially	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
prime	O
minister	O
like	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME
,	O
who	O
blindly	O
follows	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
as	O
the	O
guideline	O
of	O
his	O
diplomacy	O
,	O
was	O
rarely	O
seen	O
even	O
during	O
the	O
Cold	B-EVENT
War	I-EVENT
era	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
We	O
know	O
that	O
in	O
1957	B-DATE
Japan	B-GPE
had	O
three	B-CARDINAL
diplomatic	O
principles	O
.	O
That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
take	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
Western	B-NORP
countries	O
,	O
Asian	B-NORP
countries	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-ORGANIZATION
United	I-ORGANIZATION
Nations	I-ORGANIZATION
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
But	O
now	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME
is	O
like	O
a	O
stick	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
post	O
.	O
Right	O
.	O
It	O
takes	O
three	B-CARDINAL
points	O
to	O
support	O
a	O
plane	O
.	O
Yeah	O
.	O
So	O
,	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
stuff	O
on	O
the	O
surface	O
.	O
Well	O
,	O
some	O
prime	O
ministers	O
before	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME
at	O
least	O
would	O
still	O
properly	O
deal	O
with	O
and	O
balance	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
America	B-GPE
,	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
and	O
Asia	B-LOCATION
,	O
in	O

with	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
ah	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
Well	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Koizumi	B-PERSONNAME
,	O
he	O
only	O
takes	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
.	O
Right	O
.	O
In	O
fact	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
surely	O
fail	O
to	O
take	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
because	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
win	O
the	O
trust	O
of	O
your	O
Asian	B-NORP
neighboring	O
countries	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
will	O
not	O
fully	O
respect	O
such	O
a	O
country	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
The	O
US	B-GPE
also	O
wants	O
to	O
go	O
beyond	O
Japan	B-GPE
to	O
keep	O
good	O

with	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
,	O
and	O
other	O

Therefore	O

the	O
more	O
he	O

the	O
lower	O
will	O
be	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O

Right	O
,	O
his	O

was	O
actually	O
criticized	O
and	O
opposed	O
by	O
some	O
politicians	O
even	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE

He	O
was	O
strongly	O

Ah	O
