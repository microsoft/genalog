So	O
,	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
seized	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
hold	O
of	O
,	O
this	O
entire	O
group	O
of	O
people	O
by	O
hiring	O
them	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
reporters	O
,	O
editors	O
,	O
or	O
anchors	O
at	O
high	O
salaries	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
relatively	O
good	O
team	O
of	O
reporters	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
later	O
it	O
followed	B-NORP
that	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
er	B-CARDINAL
,	O
,	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
six	B-CARDINAL
-	O
Chinese	B-NORP
-	O
character	O
principle	O
of	O
news	O
reporting	O
called	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
independence	O
,	O
neutrality	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
neutrality	O
,	O
balance	O
,	O
and	O
freedom	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
what	O
it	O
reported	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
completely	O
different	O
style	O
from	O
that	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
Arab	B-NORP
TV	O
stations	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
respect	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
add	O
one	B-CARDINAL
point	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
its	O
style	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
characterized	O
by	O
direct	O
borrowing	O
from	O
the	O
West	B-LOCATION
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
the	O
two	B-CARDINAL
mainstream	O
media	O
outlets	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

One	B-CARDINAL
is	O
CNN	B-ORGANIZATION
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
has	O
quite	O
a	O
big	O
influence	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

Just	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
its	O
reporters	O
directly	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Middle	B-LOCATION
East	I-LOCATION
channel	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
jointly	O
run	O
by	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
and	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
.	O

So	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
foundation	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
this	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
has	O
a	O
quite	O
unique	O
structure	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
because	O
the	O
emir	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
is	O
called	O
Hamad	B-PERSONNAME
.	O

He	O
studied	O
in	O
Britain	B-GPE
and	O
therefore	O
had	O
quite	O
a	O
good	O
knowledge	O
of	O
Britain	B-GPE
's	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
TV	O
station	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
quite	O
admired	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
borrowed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
style	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
Britain	B-GPE
's	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
is	O
a	O
very	O
old	O
TV	O
group	O
established	O
in	O
1927	B-DATE
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Though	O
it	O
is	O
funded	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
its	O
properties	O
owned	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
follows	O
the	O
guideline	O
of	O
editorial	O
independence	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
the	O
top	O
decision	O
-	O
making	O
body	O
of	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
is	O
called	O
the	O
board	O
of	O
directors	O
which	O
are	O
composed	O
of	O
twelve	B-CARDINAL
members	O
directly	O
appointed	O
by	O
the	O
Queen	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
has	O
also	O
adopted	O
this	O
structure	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
top	O
seven	B-CARDINAL
-	O
member	O
board	O
of	O
directors	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
its	O
property	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
funds	O
can	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
relatively	O
has	O
its	O
editorial	O
independence	O
.	O

Eh	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
essence	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Wu	B-PERSONNAME
,	O
is	O
it	O
really	O
a	O
private	O
TV	O
station	O
or	O
a	O
government	O
-	O
run	O
TV	O
station	O
?	O

Er	O
,	O
they	O
themselves	O
claim	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
private	O
TV	O
station	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
reality	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
established	O
without	O
a	O
large	O
amount	O
of	O
financial	O
support	O
given	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
because	O
it	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
has	O
an	O
extremely	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
ads	O
during	O
its	O
around	O
the	O
clock	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
TV	O
broadcast	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
team	O
,	O
especially	O
with	O
high	O
,	O
high	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
wages	O
,	O
and	O
reporters	O
based	O
abroad	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
reporters	O
abroad	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
government	O
had	O
not	O
supported	O
such	O
expenditures	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
TV	O
station	O
to	O
survive	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
your	O
knowledge	O
,	O
how	O
much	O
is	O
its	O
yearly	O
expenditure	O
?	O

It	O
was	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
yearly	O
expenditures	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
7	B-MONEY
billion	I-MONEY
US	I-MONEY
dollars	I-MONEY
.	O

About	O
7	B-MONEY
billion	I-MONEY
US	I-MONEY
dollars	I-MONEY
,	O
that	O
is	O
equivalent	O
to	O
more	B-MONEY
than	I-MONEY
50	I-MONEY
billion	I-MONEY
RMB	I-MONEY
.	O

We	O
should	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
huge	O
financial	O
expenditure	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Extremely	O
large	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
call	O
it	O
gaining	O
voice	O
but	O
losing	O
money	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
relatively	O
small	O
revenues	O
due	O
to	O
few	O
ads	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
tremendous	O
influence	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
not	O
bad	O
in	O
gaining	O
voice	O
as	O
it	O
does	O
achieve	O
some	O
effect	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Ha	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
speaking	O
of	O
its	O
influence	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
er	O
,	O
during	O
the	B-EVENT
Afghan	I-EVENT
war	I-EVENT
,	O
er	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
the	O
exclusive	O
interview	O
right	O
to	O
enter	O
Afghanistan	B-GPE
to	O
conduct	O
independent	O
and	O
exclusive	O
interviews	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
advantages	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
also	O
presented	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
a	O
TV	O
station	O
,	O
both	O
opportunity	O
and	O
real	O
strength	O
are	O
actually	O
very	O
important	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
as	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
has	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
develop	O
into	O
its	O
current	O
status	O
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
has	O
it	O
relied	O
upon	O
so	O
that	O
its	O
competitiveness	O
and	O
influential	O
power	O
,	O
even	O
surpassed	O
CNN	B-ORGANIZATION
and	O
BBC	B-ORGANIZATION
during	O
the	B-EVENT
Iraq	I-EVENT
war	I-EVENT
?	O

The	O
greatest	O
feature	O
of	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION
Jazeera	I-ORGANIZATION
TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
station	O
that	O
competes	O
with	O
large	O
ones	O
and	O
has	O
become	O
well	O
-	O
known	O
through	O
wars	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
it	O
can	O
establish	O
itself	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
first	B-ORDINAL
relied	O
on	O
the	B-EVENT
Afghan	I-EVENT
war	I-EVENT
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	B-EVENT
Iraq	I-EVENT
war	I-EVENT
after	O
the	B-EVENT
9	I-EVENT
/	I-EVENT
11	I-EVENT
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
made	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
these	O
two	B-CARDINAL
opportunities	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
as	O
the	B-EVENT
Iraq	I-EVENT
war	I-EVENT
occurred	O
right	O
in	O
an	O
Arab	B-NORP
country	O
,	O
everyone	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
concerned	O
with	O
what	O
is	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
war	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
provides	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
viewership	O
,	O
making	O
it	O
instantly	O
famous	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
resources	O
,	O
including	O
its	O
exclusive	O
coverage	O
right	O
in	O
Afghanistan	B-GPE
as	O
you	O
mentioned	O
just	O
now	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
,	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION

TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
is	O
actually	O
quite	O
unique	O
in	O
the	O
Arab	B-NORP
region	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
tough	O
conflict	O
in	O
this	O
region	O
is	O
the	O
conflict	O
between	O
Palestine	B-NORP
and	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
Arabs	B-NORP
will	O
not	O
invite	O
the	O
Israeli	B-NORP
leader	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
speech	O
on	O
their	O
TV	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
for	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION
-	I-ORGANIZATION

TV	I-ORGANIZATION
station	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
invite	O
Barak	B-PERSONNAME
,	O
the	O
Israeli	B-NORP
prime	O
minister	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
deliver	O
a	O
speech	O
at	O
al	B-ORGANIZATION

.	O

This	O
was	O
unprecedented	O
in	O
the	O
Arab	B-NORP
world	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
also	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
unique	O
perspective	O

Uh-huh	O
