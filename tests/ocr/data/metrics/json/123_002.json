[{"text": "whole character of the nest, which Seebohm often made much of iu his classifi-\ncation, is quite unlike that of a Crow ; being neatly woven, and slung like a\nhammock between the forks of a branch : moreover, whereas the eggs of the Crows\nare usually of some shade of green or blue, heavily spotted and speckled, or\nblotched and mottled, with various shades of olive or brown, those of the Orioles\nvary from white to salmon-pink, clearly spotted with blackish-brown, and some-\ntimes with lilacine-greyisli shell-markings.\n\nThe call-notes and songs of the Orioles are bright and melodious ; but this\nfact would not be a sufficient reason for dissociating them from the Crows ;\nalthough our native species of Corvidcr do not shine as whistlers, in their wild\nstate.

In 1868, I saw a male\nspecimen of this bird near Linton, in Devonshire, and in July, 1887, I was just\ntoo late to see the species in Essex ; Mr. Fitch, of Maldon (whom I was visiting)\ninformed me that the bird had been seen in one of his thickets during the previous\n"}]
