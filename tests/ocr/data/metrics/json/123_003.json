[{"text": "week. We visited the place iu the hope of discovering a uest, but were unsuc-\ncessful.\n\nIn Ireland it has chiefly occurred on the east coast, most of the examples\nbeing females, or immature males ; a specimen was recorded as shot in the Faroe\nIslands, in Maj^ 1893, by Col. H. W. Feildeu. In June, 1906, one was killed\nby a cat on the Marine Parade at Brighton. Perhaps the nearest point to\nLondon at which it has been recognized, was noted in the \"Zoologist\" for 1892,\nan example having apparently been seen in Richmond Park.\n\nThe male of this species is bright gamboge-yellow, the lores, wings (excepting\nthe terminal third of the primary-coverts) and a great part of the tail black ; the\nprimaries, excepting the two outermost, are edged externally, and the secondaries\nare tipped with j^ellowish-white ; the two central tail-feathers are yellowish at the\nbase, and yellow at the tip, and the other feathers have the terminal third of the\nouter webs, and borders of the inner webs yellow ; bill reddish-ochreous ; feet\nleaden-grey ; iris bright red. The female is much duller than the male, greener,\nand with the black colouring replaced by deep brown ; the throat, breast, and\ncentre of belly whitish ; the throat, breast, and flanks streaked with greyish.\nYoung birds are greener and browner than the female, but otherwise similar ;\nnestlings have the upper parts olivaceous, spotted with yellow.\n\nThe Golden Oriole frequents gardens, groves, plantations, thickets, and the\noutskirts of large woods, especially in the neighbourhood of water ; it seems to\nprefer the haunts of man, yet is so shy that it rarely remains in view for more\nthan a minute as it flies rapidly, in somewhat Thrush-like, though more undulating\nfashion, from cover to cover ; choosing ever the densest foliage, as if aware of the\nperilous brilliance of its plumage : possibly it may slowly be acquiring a hereditary\nknowledge of the fact that, if but a glimpse is obtained of it, an attempt at least\nis made to put an end to its life ; or if it fails to comprehend so much, it may\ninherit a dread of the thunder and lightning which, for generations, have heralded\nits appearance : birds are not naturally fearful of man ; for even those which have\nbeen taught by their parents to dread him, can be generally converted by gentleness\nand petting : moreover the fact that a grown man can tame a small bird, whereas\neven the tamest will always show the greatest fear of a little boy, certainly seems\nto prove that the instinctive dread of the monkey-nature in the latter is deeply\nimplanted in all birds ; j ust as is that of a cat, even though that animal may\nnever have been seen by the bird previously.*\n"}]
